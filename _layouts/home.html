      <h3>Why Counterspace?</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="assets/images/star.png" class="right-star"/>
       A counterspace is an environment that promotes well-being and a sense of belonging and and allows individuals to be their whole selves in the face of challenging or hostile landscapes. 
       <p>
       A counterspace provides a space to explore and discuss the intersection of social, personal and professional identities and paves the way for increased community and individual sense of belonging.
